# 🛒 Superstore Data Engineering Pipeline on AWS

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** on AWS using a **Superstore orders dataset**. It showcases how to ingest, partition, catalog, query, and visualize time-series retail data efficiently using AWS services like S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Analyze daily Superstore orders using a scalable and cost-effective cloud pipeline.
- **Dataset**: Retail order data, partitioned by date.
- **Architecture**:

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool               | Role                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **AWS S3**         | Raw data storage (partitioned by snapshot date) |
| **AWS Glue**       | Creates data catalog & schema from S3        |
| **Amazon Athena**  | Serverless SQL querying engine                |
| **Amazon QuickSight** | Business intelligence and dashboarding   |
| **IAM**            | Access control for AWS services               |

## 📁 Folder Structure in S3

- **Bucket Name**: `superstore`
- **Main Folder**: `/orders`
- **Partitioning** `:s3://superstore/orders/snapshot=01-04-2025/orders.csv`
- s3://superstore/orders/snapshot=02-04-2025/orders.csv ...
  
> Partitioning the data by `snapshot` date improves **query performance** and **reduces cost** in Athena by scanning less data.

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. **Split Orders by Day**  
 Python script processes raw Superstore data and saves one file per day.

2. **Upload to S3**  
 All daily files are uploaded to `s3://superstore/orders/` under respective `snapshot=` subfolders.

3. **Catalog with AWS Glue**  
 - A Glue **crawler** is configured to scan the `orders` folder.
 - It automatically infers **schema**, **data types**, and **partitions**.
 - Results stored in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.

4. **Query with Amazon Athena**  
 - Athena uses the Glue catalog to run **SQL queries** directly on S3 data.
 - Queries are efficient due to **partition pruning** based on snapshot.

5. **Visualize with Amazon QuickSight**  
 - QuickSight connects to Athena as a data source.
 - Dashboards are created to explore KPIs like daily sales, top products, and customer trends.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ **Data Partitioning** for performance and cost-efficiency  
- ✅ **Serverless querying** with Athena (no ETL needed)  
- ✅ **Schema inference** with Glue  
- ✅ **Cloud-native visualization** with QuickSight  
- ✅ **End-to-end analytics** without provisioning servers

---

## 📈 Sample Use Cases

- Identify daily or weekly sales trends.
- Analyze top-selling products by region.
- Monitor order volumes and revenue spikes.
- Compare performance over different time snapshots.

---

## 📝 Next Steps & Improvements

- Automate daily ingestion using **AWS Lambda** or **Step Functions**.
- Add **data quality checks** with tools like **Great Expectations**.
- Deploy **QuickSight dashboards** as reports with scheduled refresh.
- Store original raw files in a `raw/` folder for traceability.

## 📂 Sample Athena Query

```sql
SELECT snapshot, product_name, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM superstore.orders
WHERE snapshot BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-07'
GROUP BY snapshot, product_name
ORDER BY snapshot, total_sales DESC;
```
